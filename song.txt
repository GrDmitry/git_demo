I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey
When I turn it on
All through my city,
All through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling,
When we in our zone...

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood
In my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it,
Moving so phenomenally
You gon' like the way we rock it,
So don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when
I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon,
So keep dancing
